## 📌 Background & Overview

**Objective:**

**📖 What is this project about?**

This project focuses on a deep-dive market analysis for **Elite**, the current market leader in the Liquid Milk category in Vietnam. While Elite dominates Traditional Trade (~82% of its sales), the retail landscape is shifting. This analysis aims to equip leadership with a roadmap to **capture the rapid growth of the Modern Trade (MT) channel**.

The goal is to provide clear, actionable insights to:
* **Understand channel performance** by comparing Traditional vs. Modern Trade trends.
* **Identify "White Space" distribution gaps** in high-growth retailers like VinMart+ and Bach Hoa Xanh.
* **Evaluate portfolio efficiency** by analyzing Sales Velocity (SPPD) against competitors.
* **Optimize pricing strategy** to balance rapid market share gain with brand premiumization.

**👤 Who is this project for?**

* **Senior Executives** seeking to future-proof Elite's market leadership against shifting retail trends.
* **Sales & Channel Managers** responsible for expansion into Mini-marts and Convenience Stores (CVS).
* **Brand Managers** looking to optimize the flavor, packaging, and pricing mix for urban consumers.
* **Strategy Teams** planning the "Modern Trade 2020" expansion and investment roadmap.

**🎯 Project Outcome:**

*   **Organic is the primary growth engine:** The Organic segment saw a massive **105.03% YoY growth**, yet Elite maintains an extremely low **Price Index of 67.40**. This suggests share is being gained via heavy discounting rather than brand premiumization, missing a major margin opportunity.
*   **The Physical Reach Gap:** While Elite has solid presence in high-volume supermarkets (**44.14% Weighted Distribution**), it is missing from over 70% of total Modern Trade outlets (**28.40% Numeric Distribution**), particularly in the rapidly growing CVS and Mini-mart sectors.
*   **Retailer Growth Levers:** **VinMart+ and Bach Hoa Xanh** represent the most significant untapped opportunities. The "Store Gap" in these two retailers alone shows that Elite is failing to keep pace with the fastest-growing modern retail chains in Vietnam.
*   **Efficiency vs. Competitor Pull:** Competitors like **Farmy** and **Wonderland** deliver significantly higher **Sales Velocity (SPPD)**—in some segments nearly **2x more than Elite**. This indicates that while Elite has more "reach," competitors have stronger "shelf pull" and higher inventory turnover per store.
*   **The Conversion Bottleneck:** Consumer data reveals a massive **"Trial Gap"**; while **57.57%** of consumers are aware of the brand, only **14.24%** have ever used it. This highlights a failure to convert marketing awareness into physical first-time purchases.
*   **Portfolio "Hero" SKU:** The **180ml Sweetened Carton** is the undisputed efficiency leader across both segments. It moves faster and generates more revenue per point of distribution than any other format, making it the mandatory "lead item" for all new listings.

By shifting from a **volume-at-all-costs** model to a **premiumization and conversion** strategy—specifically targeting store gaps in **VinMart+** and bridging the **awareness-to-trial gap** through sampling—Elite can successfully future-proof its leadership in the Modern Trade era.

### I. Market Overview

#### Type: [Organic]
<img width="1920" height="1079" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40dc348a-752c-464f-b733-62e52ba6100b" />

#### Type: [Regular]
<img width="1921" height="1084" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49eab76d-9473-4f43-a6a0-45619dd7b7b4" />

### ⭐ Key Findings — Modern Trade Overview

**1. Organic is the Growth Engine; Regular is Stagnant**  
- **Organic** sales grew strongly by **12.17% YoY** (reaching 4.11K BiLVND).  
- **Regular** sales remained flat with a slight decline of **-0.04% YoY** (7.27K BiLVND).  
→ Growth is currently driven by the **premium Organic segment**, while the "cash cow" Regular segment has stalled.

**2. Aggressive "Low-Price" Strategy Across Both Segments**  
- Price Index for Organic is extremely low at **52.64**, and Regular is at **65.24**.  
- Elite is priced roughly **35–48% below the market average** for these categories.  
→ High sales volume is being driven by **heavy discounting**, leaving significant room for margin improvement through premiumization.

**3. Strong Presence in Large Stores, But a Massive Listing Gap**  
- Weighted Distribution (WD) is high (**~66-67%**), indicating presence in major hypermarkets.  
- Numeric Distribution (ND) is significantly lower (**~43-47%**).  
→ Elite is missing from over **50% of total Modern Trade outlets**, representing a prime expansion opportunity in Mini-marts and CVS.

**4. Efficiency Gap: Competitors are Selling Faster**  
- In the Regular segment, **Wonderland** achieves an SPPD of **5.07K**, nearly **double Elite’s 2.73K**.  
- In Organic, Wonderland also leads in efficiency with an SPPD of **3.09K** vs. Elite’s **2.52K**.  
→ Competitors have **higher shelf velocity**; Elite needs to improve merchandising and visibility to match competitor efficiency.

**5. Market Leadership is Under Threat in Regular Milk**  
- In the Regular category, **Wonderland** has reached a **4.13% market share**, nearly equal to Elite’s **4.17%**.  
- Wonderland is achieving this with **fewer stores** (37% ND), proving much stronger consumer pull per outlet.  
→ Elite must defend its core segment against Wonderland through targeted loyalty programs or SKU rationalization.

**6. Massive Revenue Potential in Regular Segment**  
- The **Regular segment (16.1K BiLVND)** is 3.5x larger than the **Organic segment (4.6K BiLVND)**.  
- Even a small % increase in Regular MT share would result in massive revenue gains compared to Organic growth.  
→ Strategic priority: **Revitalize the Regular portfolio** while scaling the high-growth Organic engine.
  
### II.Segment & Pricing

#### Type: [Organic]
<img width="1917" height="1083" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211aa8cf-f548-42d8-91da-166575f5c010" />

#### Type: [Regular]
<img width="1931" height="1084" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1adcd540-76c6-442b-9a2e-bd740fcb5a24" />

### ⭐ Key Findings — Segment & Pricing

**1. "Sweetened" is the Must-Have Flavor**  
- Across both segments, **Sweetened milk** is the overwhelming consumer favorite, significantly outperforming Plain and Less Sugar variants.
- In the Regular segment, niche flavors like Vanilla and Strawberry capture minimal market share.  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Lead all Modern Trade listings and promotional activities with Sweetened SKUs to guarantee volume.

**2. 180ml Carton is the "Hero" Format**  
- The **180ml carton** is the highest-selling size in both Organic (2.03K) and Regular (4.77K) categories.
- While the 1000ml pack offers a lower price per 100ml, it has much lower sales traction in Modern Trade.  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Prioritize prime eye-level shelf space for the 180ml format, as it is the primary revenue driver for the channel.

**3. The Premiumization Gap (Elite vs. Wonderland)**  
- Competitor **Wonderland** prices its products **4x to 5x higher** than Elite, yet achieves significantly higher sales velocity (SPPD).
- Elite is currently the lowest-priced brand in both segments, suggesting it is leaving significant margin "on the table."  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Explore a "Premium Tier" sub-brand to compete with Wonderland and capture high-income urban consumers.

**4. Packaging Segmentation: TFA vs. Carton**  
- **TFA packaging** is a major driver in the Regular segment (40.8% share) but is nearly non-existent in the Organic category.
- TFA pricing is significantly lower (~2,187 VND/100ml) compared to Cartons (~4,721 VND/100ml).  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Use TFA packs as the high-volume "entry-level" option for Regular milk, while maintaining Organic as a premium, Carton-only line.

**5. SKU Proliferation in the Regular Segment**  
- Elite’s Regular portfolio is highly fragmented across brands like **Unami, Goldmilk, Star, and Pro Plus**.
- The Organic portfolio is streamlined, concentrated almost entirely on **Unami Organic**.  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Conduct SKU rationalization for Regular milk to reduce complexity and focus marketing spend on the core Unami brand.

**6. MT Consumers are Brand-Driven, Not Price-Driven**  
- Despite having the lowest Price Index, Elite does not have the highest sales velocity; premium-priced brands like **Farmy** and **Wonderland** move faster off the shelf.  
→ **Strategic Focus:** Pivot marketing communication from "Affordability" to "Superior Nutrition" to increase brand pull in the Modern Trade channel.
     
### III. Availability & Efficiency

<img width="1929" height="1063" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462b27ac-4c48-4f51-af42-90992b95cafa" />

### ⭐ Key Findings — Availability & Efficiency

**1. Massive Distribution Gap at Major Retailers**
- **VinMart+** and **Bach Hoa Xanh** represent the largest untapped opportunities; at VinMart+, the "Store Gap" is currently larger than the number of stores carrying Elite.
- Other key listing gaps exist in **Circle K** and **Co.op Food**.
→ **Strategic Focus:** Launch an immediate sales push to close listing gaps in VinMart+ and Bach Hoa Xanh to rapidly scale market share.

**2. 180ml Pack is the Efficiency King**
- The **180ml pack size** delivers the highest Sales Velocity (SPPD) at over 3M VND per point of distribution.
- The **1000ml pack** is the least efficient, showing less than half the velocity of the 180ml size.
→ **Strategic Focus:** Lead with the 180ml pack as the primary SKU when expanding into new stores to ensure high inventory turnover.

**3. Quality over Quantity (High WD vs. Moderate ND)**
- Elite maintains a high **Weighted Distribution (WD) of 66.6%**, but a much lower **Numeric Distribution (ND) of 44.7%**.
- Elite is successfully present in high-volume "Big" stores (Hypermarkets) but is missing from the "Long Tail" of smaller outlets.
→ **Strategic Focus:** Future growth must come from "Numeric" expansion into small-format CVS and Mini-marts now that big-store presence is saturated.

**4. TFA Packs Have Better Reach than Cartons**
- **TFA packaging** has higher Numeric (46.5%) and Weighted Distribution (69%) compared to Cartons in the Modern Trade channel.
- This indicates TFA is the preferred format for smaller retailers with limited shelf space.
→ **Strategic Focus:** Leverage existing TFA distribution networks as a "foot in the door" to cross-sell and introduce Carton SKUs.

**5. Distribution Quality Index (WD-ND) is Increasing**
- The gap between WD and ND trended upwards toward Q4, meaning Elite is becoming more concentrated in high-value stores.
- Elite is failing to keep pace with the rapid store openings of smaller-format competitors.
→ **Strategic Focus:** "Democratize" brand availability to ensure Elite does not become an "exclusive" brand only found in large supermarkets.

**6. Market Leader by Share, but Not by Reach**
- While Elite leads in total volume, **Goldmilk** actually has higher Numeric Distribution (Reach).
- Consumers encounter Goldmilk in more physical locations, even if they buy Elite in higher volumes elsewhere.
→ **Strategic Focus:** Increase brand visibility by matching Goldmilk’s numeric reach to prevent share loss via consumer convenience and proximity.

### IV. Purchase Behavior

<img width="1932" height="1081" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5897bcc-9a0b-46d4-afb7-985482ec490d" />

### ⭐ Key Findings — Purchase Behavior

**1. Extreme Health Consciousness and Willingness to Pay**
*   An overwhelming **97.7% of consumers** express high health concern, with nearly **90% prioritizing health** in their purchase decisions.
*   Crucially, **74.4% of consumers are willing to pay more** for healthier options.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** High "Willingness to Pay" justifies a higher Price Index and premium positioning if health benefits (e.g., Organic certification) are clearly communicated.

**2. The "Trial Gap": High Awareness but Low Conversion**
*   The purchase journey shows a massive drop-off: **57.6% are aware** of the product, but only **14.2% have ever used it**.
*   Marketing is successfully reaching the audience, but they are not yet committing to the first purchase.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** Implement "Trial-Driving" activities such as in-store sampling or small "trial packs" to bridge the gap between awareness and first-time usage.

**3. Word-of-Mouth and Point-of-Sale (POS) Outperform Digital**
*   **Word of Mouth** is the #1 information source, followed by **Visibility at the Point of Sale** and TV advertising.
*   Social Media (Facebook/Instagram) currently has the lowest influence on purchase behavior in this category.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** Reallocate digital ad spend toward **Trade Marketing** (premium shelf displays) and community-based advocacy to leverage the power of personal recommendations.

**4. Supermarkets are the Undisputed "Home" of Organic Milk**
*   Supermarkets (like Co.op Mart) are the primary purchase channel in both HCMC and Hanoi.
*   Despite the general growth of Mini-marts, organic milk consumers still prefer "Bulk/Weekly" shopping in larger formats.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** Maintain Supermarkets as the "Core" volume channel while using CVS/Mini-marts strictly for "Reach" and trial availability.

**5. Organic Milk is an "Occasional" Purchase, Not a Daily Habit**
*   The majority of consumers buy organic milk **2-3 times a month**; daily or weekly consumption remains a niche behavior.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** Increase consumption frequency by promoting the benefits of daily organic intake (e.g., "A Glass a Day" campaigns) to move the product from a luxury treat to a household staple.

**6. Strong Intention to Buy in the Immediate Future**
*   **41.2% of consumers** express a clear intention to purchase or use the product within the next 3 months.
*   → **Strategic Focus:** Focus near-term sales targets on capturing this "Intent" through high-visibility promotions during the peak periods identified in the Q1-Q4 trend data.
